# TicTacToe-Python

A tic-tac-toe game in Python using string-based graphics. 

User can choose between playing multiplayer or single player against the computer. In single player mode, I implemented an AI algorithm that examines all possible scenarios in the current gamestate, and determines the best possible next move to make, whether it be a move to win the game or settle for a tie by blocking an anticipated spot that would put the player one move closer to winning.
